    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome!  I now have a blog!</p>

<p>Why start now after years of blogosphere silence, you ask?  Well...</p>

<!--more-->


<p>In the past two weeks I have been to both <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com/">ChefConf</a> and <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-austin/">DevOpsDaysAustin</a>.  Both of these events were full of incredibly
smart, genuinely passionate, and accessable folks who were all a pleasure to talk to.  I learned a lot, and tried to share with others as much as I could.  But alas, the conferences are over and I'd like to keep the ball rolling.  So...</p>

<p>This blog will be a collection of my thoughts and opinions, heavily influenced by and/or outright stolen from others (with appropriate credits/sources).</p>

<p>Without the great conversation and tooling coming from the community, I'd have nothing.  I hope to share a few things that will help others, and learn from anybody interested enough to leave a comment!</p>

<p>I'll also probably post a bit about Music and DadOps stuff here and there...</p>

<p>Let's see where this goes!</p>

<p><em>... and let's hope I don't just abandon it after 3 posts.</em></p>
