    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>In the past two weeks I have been to both ChefConf and DevOpsDays Austin.  Both of these events
were full of genuinely smart, geeky, and accessable folks who were all a pleasure to talk to.</p>

<p>One of the hot topics on my agenda is building a workflow for team Chef development that
allows for continuous integration to be performed on cookbooks, and prevents folks from stepping
on each other's toes on a shared Chef server.  A key component of this workflow is Berkshelf.</p>

<p>In addition to the conferences, I have taken a LOT of inspiration from several key episodes of the FoodFightShow.</p>

<p>This post is my take on of the ideas of others.  Without the great conversation and tooling coming from the community, I'd have nothing.  :)</p>

<h2>Key Points and Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Developers must be able to collaborate on a single Chef server without squashing each others changes.</li>
<li>Cookbooks must be treated like independent software projects with a name, dependencies, a version, a git repository, a CI job, unit tests and functional tests.</li>
<li>Cookbooks uploaded to a Chef server must be treated as versioned immutable artifacts.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Credits</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://berkshelf.com/">Berkshelf</a> - Berkshelf.com has a great overview of how to get started.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYt0E84kYUI">Jamie@ChefConf</a> - Jamie Winsor gave an awesome talk about 'The Berkshelf Way' at ChefConf 2013.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.foodfightshow.org">FoodFightShow</a> - If you use Chef, you should listen to this show.  Because of reasons.</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Berkshelf FTW.</em></p>
