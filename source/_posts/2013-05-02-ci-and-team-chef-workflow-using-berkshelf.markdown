In the past two weeks I have been to both ChefConf and DevOpsDays Austin.  Both of these events
were full of genuinely smart, geeky, and accessable folks who were all a pleasure to talk to.

One of the hot topics on my agenda is building a workflow for team Chef development that
allows for continuous integration to be performed on cookbooks, and prevents folks from stepping
on each other's toes on a shared Chef server.  A key component of this workflow is Berkshelf.

Blahblahblah.
