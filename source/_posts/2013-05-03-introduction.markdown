Welcome!
--------
I now have a blog!  

Why start now after years of blogosphere silence, you ask?  Well...

<!--more-->

In the past two weeks I have been to both [ChefConf] and [DevOpsDaysAustin].  Both of these events were full of incredibly
smart, genuinely passionate, and accessable folks who were all a pleasure to talk to.  I learned a lot, and tried to share with others as much as I could.  But alas, the conferences are over and I'd like to keep the ball rolling.  So...

This blog will be a collection of my thoughts and opinions, heavily influenced by and/or outright stolen from others (with appropriate credits/sources).  

Without the great conversation and tooling coming from the community, I'd have nothing.  I hope to share a few things that will help others, and learn from anybody interested enough to leave a comment!

I'll also probably post a bit about Music and DadOps stuff here and there...

Let's see where this goes!

*... and let's hope I don't just abandon it after 3 posts.*
